# lerdorf_output

This folder has all of the raw XML output that was generated by [lerdorf](lerdorf.com/pl.php).

Lerdorf has a maximum size input, so they had to be chunked into 7 batches, approximately 1000 toponyms each. Thus, the file name is a rough index of how many toponyms have been read so far (very rough approximation).
